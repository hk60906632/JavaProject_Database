Code Quality Feedback for 97418:
Some of your method names are potentially problematic in that they contain underscores and are just single words. The following methods are really quite long: Databases.commands(), Databases.main() and Tables.main(). Could they be refactored into shorter, separate methods ? The following methods have high density of IF/CASE statements: Databases.commands() and Tables.check_type(). Perhaps these could be implemented more elegantly ? The following classes have very deep nesting: Databases and Tables. This could make them difficult to maintain in the long term. Be aware that there are some tightly coupled pairs of classes (Databases<->Tables and Tables<->Records) which may benefit from refactoring to improve encapsulation and separation. Your code might benefit from some additional descriptive comments. The following methods have particularly complex structures: Databases.commands(), Tables.add_column() and Tables.check_type() - this might make them difficult to comprehend. There are declared but unused local variables in a some of your classes (Files->s and Files->record). The following classes contain double blank lines: Databases and Tables, which take up unnecessary space. The following classes contain some unusual indentation: Databases and Tables. Significant amounts of code has been replicated in Tables. Avoid copy-and-paste duplication: keep your code DRY ! Your code contains some "copy-and-pasted" method similarities: Tables.save()-Tables.save_as(). Remember to keep your code DRY !
